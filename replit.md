# Odanet - Flatmate & Room Rental Platform

## Overview
Odanet is a flatmate and room rental platform for the Turkish market, connecting individuals seeking shared accommodation with room providers. It focuses on verified profiles, intelligent matching, and secure communication to build a trustworthy environment. Key capabilities include comprehensive user and listing management, seeker profiles, real-time messaging, and advanced search and filtering.

## Recent Changes (Nov 10, 2025)

### Phase 1: Cross-Platform Data Flow Fixes
- **Centralized Configuration**: Created `config.ts` with unified API_URL and image normalization helpers for consistent URL handling across web/mobile platforms.
- **Backend Routing**: Added slug-based detail endpoints (`/api/listings/slug/:slug`, `/api/seekers/slug/:slug`) with proper publish/active filtering, plus ID-based endpoints for mobile compatibility.
- **Mobile Image Fix**: Resolved seeker profile photo display issues by implementing `getImageUrl()` helper in UnifiedCard component to prepend base URL to relative paths.
- **Mobile Listing Detail Fix**: Corrected `useListing` hook to unwrap API responses properly, restoring title/price/description display on detail screens.
- **Web Detail Pages**: Fixed "İlan Bulunamadı" errors by ensuring backend returns flat objects matching frontend expectations and enforcing proper status checks.

### Phase 2: Dynamic Image Fallback System (Latest)
- **Smart Placeholder System**: Enhanced `getImageUrl()` with deterministic CDN-hosted placeholders for seekers without photos (5 unique images selected by ID hash) and listings without images (single default placeholder).
- **Robust Hash Distribution**: Implemented full-string hash function (FNV-1a style) ensuring even distribution of seeker placeholders across entire UUID, replacing weak first-character hashing.
- **Graceful Degradation**: Added onError handler in UnifiedCard component that falls back to gradient placeholder when CDN images fail to load, preventing broken image states.
- **Component Lifecycle Fix**: Implemented useEffect hook keyed to item.id to reset imageError state when card components are recycled during scrolling, ensuring fresh image load attempts.
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained API suffix removal (`/api` → base URL) for web platform compatibility while adding optional type and ID parameters for mobile smart fallbacks.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The platform features a mobile-first design with consistent branding. Web app uses shadcn/ui with Radix components and teal/turquoise primary color (#00A6A6). Mobile app rebuilt with purple gradient design system (#7F00FF → #E100FF) matching new brand identity, featuring gradient headers, white cards with gradient shadows, rounded corners (16px), and icon-based navigation. Logo displays at top with platform tagline "Güvenilir ve şeffaf oda arama deneyimi". Home screen features unified feed showing both room listings and seeker profiles mixed chronologically (sorted by createdAt descending), matching website homepage experience. All screens use real API data with proper loading and empty states.

### Technical Implementations
- **Frontend (Web)**: React with TypeScript (Vite), Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Radix UI for accessibility. State management uses React Query for server state and React hooks for local state. Wouter handles client-side routing, and i18next provides internationalization (Turkish primary locale). Detail pages use slug-based routing (`/oda-ilani/[slug]`, `/oda-arayan/[slug]`) for SEO-friendly URLs.
- **Frontend (Mobile)**: Expo SDK 54 + React Native 0.81.5, Expo Router for file-based navigation, React Native StyleSheet API for all styling with centralized theme system (theme/colors.ts, fonts.ts, spacing.ts). Purple gradient design (#7F00FF → #E100FF) with light violet background (#F7F5FB), white cards with gradient shadows. React Native Web support for unified web/mobile codebase. TanStack Query for data fetching, SecureStore for JWT token management with automatic Authorization header attachment, expo-linear-gradient for all gradient effects. Custom UI components (PrimaryButton with purple gradient, SecondaryButton with gradient outline, ListingCard, SeekerCard) all using theme tokens. Home screen displays unified chronological feed of both listings and seekers sorted by createdAt (newest first), mirroring website homepage. Login/Register screen with purple gradient header and tab switcher. Profile screen with gradient header, white menu cards, and "Popüler Oda Arkadaşları" horizontal scroll section. Images use automatic URL normalization via centralized config helper. Bottom tab navigation with purple active states (Home, Messages, Favorites, Profile). Production-ready with EAS build configuration for Android and iOS deployment.
- **Backend**: Express.js with TypeScript. PostgreSQL is used as the database with Drizzle ORM. The API is RESTful with standardized error handling. All detail endpoints (`/api/listings/:id`, `/api/listings/slug/:slug`, `/api/seekers/slug/:slug`) return flat objects with eager-loaded relations (images, photos, user data) and enforce publish/active filters.
- **Configuration**: Centralized `config.ts` at project root exports `API_URL` (environment-aware), `getImageUrl()` helper for normalizing relative/absolute image paths, and `getApiUrl()` for building endpoint URLs. Single source of truth used by web (Vite), mobile (Expo Metro), and server.
- **Authentication**: Unified JWT-based authentication supporting both Google OAuth and email/password. All auth flows set identical secure cookies (`auth_token`) with SameSite=None, Secure flags, and domain `.odanet.com.tr` for production. OAuth callback: `https://www.odanet.com.tr/api/oauth/google/callback`. Mobile app uses SecureStore for token persistence with automatic header attachment. Google OAuth for mobile requires backend to redirect to `odanet://auth?token=<JWT>` for token capture via WebBrowser.openAuthSessionAsync.
- **File Upload System**: Supports multiple image uploads, optimized for mobile with HEIC/HEIF to JPEG conversion, compression, and resizing using Sharp and Busboy. Cloudflare R2 serves as the CDN for production image delivery. All upload endpoints require JWT authentication with ownership verification.
- **SEO**: Implemented with React Helmet for dynamic meta tags, Open Graph, and Twitter card generation for social media sharing. Slugs are generated for listings and seeker profiles for SEO-friendly URLs.
- **Blog System**: Markdown-based content management using gray-matter for frontmatter parsing and react-markdown with remark-gfm for rendering. Blog posts stored as .md files in src/content/blog/ with YAML frontmatter (slug, title, description, date, author, image). Vite configured with vite-plugin-node-polyfills to provide Buffer/global/process polyfills for Node.js libraries in browser environment.
- **SEO Optimization**: Comprehensive sitemap.xml auto-generated via scripts/generateSitemap.js, dynamically fetching all active listings, published seeker profiles, and blog posts from API endpoints. RSS feed (rss.xml) generated for blog content. robots.txt configured for search engine crawlers. Sitemap includes 40+ URLs with proper priorities and change frequencies. Run `node scripts/generateSitemap.js` to regenerate after content changes. 301 redirect middleware automatically redirects legacy UUID-only URLs (`/oda-ilani/{uuid}`) to SEO-friendly slug-based URLs (`/oda-ilani/{slug}`) for better search engine indexing and link equity preservation.
- **Mobile Build System**: EAS (Expo Application Services) configured with development, preview, and production profiles. Android builds use APK format for preview (easy sharing) and AAB for production (Play Store). iOS builds configured with bundle identifier and resource classes. All dependencies aligned with Expo SDK 51 (16/16 expo-doctor checks passed).
