Please update and unify the “Oda Arama İlanı” and “Tercihlerim” system into a single, consistent flow. 
The current forms and data connections are partially duplicated — they should now function as one unified experience with synced data and working photo uploads.

---

### 🔹 1. Unified “Oda Arama” Data Model
- Merge the existing “SeekerProfile” and “Preferences” structures into a single combined form. 
- Keep the most relevant and high-priority fields from both:
  **From Oda Arama Form:**
    - Ad Soyad
    - Yaş
    - Cinsiyet
    - Durum (Öğrenci, Çalışan vb.)
    - Aylık kira bütçesi
    - Lokasyon (oda/ev aradığı yer)
    - Kısa açıklama (kendini tanıtma)
    - Profil fotoğrafı
  **From Tercihlerim:**
    - Sigara tercihi
    - Evcil hayvan tercihi
    - Temizlik seviyesi
    - Sosyallik seviyesi
    - Çalışma saatleri
    - Cinsiyet tercihi (ev arkadaşı)
    - Yaş aralığı (min-max)

- Create a unified schema (e.g. `SeekerProfileExtended`) where all these fields are stored.
- Ensure that the form automatically populates from any previously saved data (if the user already filled it).

---

### 🔹 2. Photo Upload Functionality
- Fix the photo upload system so that:
  1. User can upload their profile photo (PNG, JPG, WebP up to 5MB).
  2. The uploaded image is saved to the server or storage system (as in “uploads” folder or equivalent).
  3. The uploaded image URL is stored in the seeker profile record.
  4. The same image is automatically displayed:
     - On the user’s profile page,
     - On the “Oda Arayanlar” listing cards on the homepage.
  5. If no image is uploaded, show a clean default placeholder avatar.

- Test end-to-end upload and display (from file selection → API save → DB → homepage card).

---

### 🔹 3. Profile and Listing Sync
- When the user updates their “Oda Arama” form or “Tercihlerim” section:
  - The updates should immediately sync to both the user’s profile and their public “Oda Arayanlar” card.
  - Any changes in budget, age, gender, or preferences should reflect in real-time.
- Prevent duplicate data or desynchronized states — everything must reference one profile record per user.

---

### 🔹 4. Form Flow & Navigation
- Keep both top menu items visible:
  - “Oda İlanı Ver”
  - “Oda Arama İlanı Ver”
- When the user clicks “Oda Arama İlanı Ver”:
  - Direct them to the new **Unified Form**.
  - After completion, automatically create or update the user’s seeker profile and show confirmation.
- In the profile page, under “Hızlı İşlemler,” make both buttons lead to their respective unified pages:
  - “Oda İlanı Ver” → Room Listing Form
  - “Oda Arama İlanı Ver” → Unified Seeker Form

---

### 🔹 5. Homepage Integration
- Once the seeker profile is created or updated:
  - Display it as a card under the “Oda Arayanlar” section on the homepage.
  - Card should show:
    - Profile photo
    - Ad Soyad (first name + initial)
    - Yaş
    - Cinsiyet
    - Bütçe (₺x.xxx/ay)
    - Lokasyon
    - Cinsiyet tercihi or sigara bilgisi (if filled)

- Make sure the data shown in cards always reflects the latest updates from the profile.

---

### 🔹 6. Testing & Validation
- Test full flow end-to-end:
  1. Create new seeker profile.
  2. Upload photo.
  3. Update preferences and personal info.
  4. Confirm homepage card shows updated info and image.
  5. Reload profile → confirm data consistency.
- Ensure backend API validation accepts both string and number formats correctly (fix any “Expected string, received number” issues).

---

✅ Expected Outcome:
- A single, clean, working “Oda Arama İlanı Ver” system.
- Photo upload fully functional.
- All profile data (personal + preferences) synchronized and displayed correctly.
- Homepage cards dynamically showing accurate, updated seeker information.
