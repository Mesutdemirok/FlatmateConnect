Prompt for Replit Agent:

Please perform a safe workspace cleanup for my Replit environment.
⚠️ Do not delete any files or folders related to the production Odanet / FlatmateConnect web app.
That includes:

client/
server/
app/
routes/
drizzle/
migrations/
components/
constants/
hooks/
lib/
public/
vite.config.ts
drizzle.config.ts
app.config.ts
package.json
tsconfig.json
tailwind.config.ts

These must remain untouched.

🧹 1️⃣ Delete Only These (Mobile + Temporary Files)

Remove entirely:

odanet-mobile/
odanet-clean/
FlatmateConnect/
FlatmateConnect-1/
mobile-test/
mobile/

Remove all temporary, duplicate, and auto-generated files created by repair scripts or agents:

*.md
*.log
*.tmp
*.bak
*.report

❗️Except for the official documentation files:

README.md
PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md
TECHNICAL_SPECS.md
DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md
FEATURE_REQUIREMENTS.md

Delete also any known unnecessary markdowns:

BABEL_ERROR_FIXED.md
BABEL_FIX_COMPLETE.md
VALIDATION_COMPLETE.md
IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
DEPLOYMENT_READY.md
DEPLOYMENT_SAFETY.md
SETUP.md
QUICK_START.sh
RUN_EXPO.sh
ERROR_LOGS.md

Remove all build and cache directories:

.expo/
.cache/
dist/
build/
tmp/
node_modules/ (inside deleted mobile projects only)


⸻

⚙️ 2️⃣ Verify and Preserve Web App Setup

After cleanup, confirm the following remain intact and unchanged:

client/
server/
routes/
drizzle/
migrations/
lib/
public/
vite.config.ts
package.json
app.config.ts
tsconfig.json
tailwind.config.ts

These are critical for the Odanet/FlatmateConnect website running at www.odanet.com.tr — they must not be deleted or altered.

⸻

🧱 3️⃣ Rebuild Workspace Cache

Once cleanup is complete:

npm cache clean --force
npm install

Do not reinitialize a new project or overwrite the existing package.json — just reinstall dependencies to refresh the workspace.

⸻

🧾 4️⃣ Output Summary

After cleanup, provide:
	•	List of all deleted mobile-related and temporary files
	•	Confirmation that web app structure remains intact
	•	Message:

✅ Cleanup complete.
Odanet Mobile project and redundant files removed.
Web app configuration preserved and verified safe.
Workspace ready for new mobile app setup.
