Here’s a single, clean prompt you can paste to Replit Agent. It tells the agent exactly what to check, fix, and prove with working evidence.

[COMMAND MODE]
Apply all necessary code changes now.
Do not just plan — modify files, run the app, and verify in Preview.
Report back with a short changelog (files edited + what changed) and a checklist of passes/fails.

⸻

🎯 Objective

Do a full quality pass of the Odanet app and fix all broken buttons/links, routing, and data flows, especially:
	•	“Oda Arayan” (room seeker) cards not appearing on the homepage,
	•	“Aramaya Geri Dön” button on listing detail leads to 404,
	•	“Giriş Yap” button sometimes not visible / turns off,
	•	Any other broken interactions, console errors, or missing imports/aliases.

Keep all routes in Turkish and ensure the site works for logged-out and logged-in users.

⸻

🧭 Context (repeat these exact checks)
	1.	I created a few Oda Arayan profiles; none show in the homepage section “Oda Arayanlar”.
	2.	On listing detail page, clicking “Aramaya Geri Dön” takes me to 404.
	3.	The Giriş Yap button sometimes disappears or is not visible.
	4.	Some links and buttons don’t respond; there are random 404s and HMR overlays.
	5.	Build/Preview sometimes fails due to import aliases (e.g., @components).

Fix these and any similar issues you find.

🔧 Tasks to Implement & Verify

1) Set up & sanity checks
	•	Run: npm install, then npm run dev (or the project’s Run workflow).
	•	Clear console; fix all import alias issues.
	•	Prefer the existing @ alias to client/src.
	•	Replace @components/... with @/components/... or define an alias in both tsconfig.json and vite.config.ts:
	•	@ -> client/src
	•	@components -> client/src/components
	•	Resolve any Vite “pre-transform” errors and TypeScript path mismatches.

2) Routing & Links (Turkish slugs only)
	•	Ensure all main routes exist and work:
	•	/, /giris, /uye-ol, /profil, /ilan-olustur, /oda-arama-ilani-olustur, /oda-ilani/:id, /oda-arayanlar
	•	Listing Detail back button “Aramaya Geri Dön”:
	•	Implement back with fallback: if history has no previous list page, go to / (or /oda-ilanlari if that’s your list route).
	•	No more 404 here.
	•	All header & footer links must navigate without 404s (desktop & mobile menu).

3) Auth & Header buttons
	•	Giriş Yap button must always be visible when logged out (no gradient/background clash, no CSS that hides it).
	•	After successful login, redirect to /profil.
	•	For logged-in users, ensure Profil and Çıkış Yap are visible and clickable.
	•	Mobile menu: icons/buttons clickable, no overlap or unclickable layers.
	•	Icon badges behind buttons: use a light orange background for icon-only buttons to match footer social style (keep existing design otherwise).

4) Oda Arayan (room seeker) data pipeline
	•	Unify the seeker profile + preferences (already started). Confirm the public card source is the unified model.
	•	Create a test Oda Arayan profile (with a photo).
	•	It must appear under “Oda Arayanlar” on the homepage without login.
	•	Cards show: photo (or avatar fallback), ad soyad (ad + baş harf), yaş, bütçe /ay, lokasyon (no duplicates), and compact styling.
	•	Profile edits (age/budget/photo) must sync immediately to homepage cards.

5) Oda İlanı (room listing) flow
	•	Create a test room listing with 2–3 photos.
	•	Listing card rules (mobile-first):
	•	Single price pill only (remove any duplicate monthly price elsewhere on the card).
	•	Remove “Hemen Müsait”; keep the title max 4 words (truncate with …).
	•	Remove the small location/map icon; tighten vertical gaps on mobile; reduce space between listings.
	•	Polished card background (very light gradient), image slightly left-biased is fine — keep tasteful spacing.
	•	Listing detail page: /ay (monthly), no rating points like “4.8 • 12 reviews”, remove placeholders.
	•	Ensure images render correctly from /uploads or whatever storage is configured.

6) Buttons/links audit (site-wide)
	•	Click every button and link on:
	•	Header (desktop + mobile), Footer, Homepage, Listing cards, Listing detail, Profile tabs, Create forms (both), Login/Signup.
	•	Fix any “no-op” clicks, incorrect routes, or disabled buttons.
	•	Ensure “Favorilere Ekle” and favorite hearts work; unauthenticated users should be redirected to /giris.

7) Error handling & overlays
	•	Remove/avoid dev overlay crashes in Preview.
	•	Guard UI against undefined values (e.g., listing?.title, images?.[0] fallback) to avoid “undefined is not an object” on mobile.
	•	Show friendly toasts for auth errors and failed form submissions.

8) Turkish-only localization
	•	Remove remaining English copy anywhere (Profile “Account Details”, etc.).
	•	Keep all slugs and labels fully Turkish.

9) Health checks
	•	Add a simple /api/health endpoint returning { ok: true, version, env }.
	•	Log useful errors to console (server) and avoid noisy client logs.
	•	Optional: add a minimal “QA checklist” markdown in repo root summarizing verified flows.

⸻

✅ Acceptance Criteria (must all pass)
	•	No console errors in Preview.
	•	All main routes above load, no 404s.
	•	“Aramaya Geri Dön” never 404s; goes back to list or falls back to /.
	•	Giriş Yap is visible when logged out and never disappears; after login user lands on /profil.
	•	At least 1 Oda Arayan test profile appears on homepage cards (logged-out view).
	•	At least 1 Oda İlanı test listing appears; cards have single monthly price pill; compact title (≤ 4 words), no “Hemen Müsait”, no rating dots.
	•	Card spacing tightened on mobile; no map/location icon on cards; less gap between cards.
	•	Header icon-only buttons have light orange background (as requested), desktop & mobile.
	•	All copy Turkish; no English remnants.
	•	Import/alias errors resolved (no Vite pre-transform errors).
	•	Uploads work; images show on cards and detail pages.
	•	Provide a short changelog (files touched + summary), and list the test steps you executed with results.
