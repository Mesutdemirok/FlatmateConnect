Goal: Remove Replit Auth from this app and use the app’s own email/password + JWT auth (Turkish UI kept). After this change, users should register/login on our site (no Replit popup) and then access /create-listing successfully.

Do the following end-to-end (you make the edits):
	1.	Disable Replit Auth for this project. If a Replit Auth integration is active (Tools → Auth or Publishing → Advanced settings), turn it off so the OAuth popup never appears.
	2.	Remove any Replit-auth code from the repo:
	•	Delete imports/usage of any @replit/* auth libs, ReplitAuthClient, or middlewares forcing Replit login.
	3.	Ensure local JWT auth endpoints exist and are wired:
	•	Backend routes:
	•	POST /api/auth/register (email, password, first/last name)
	•	POST /api/auth/login → returns httpOnly cookie or JSON { token }
	•	GET /api/auth/me (protected)
	•	POST /api/auth/logout
	•	Middleware: JWT verify for protected routes (e.g., /api/listings create/edit/delete).
	4.	CORS + env vars:
	•	Set/confirm envs (Publishing → Advanced settings → Environment variables):
	•	JWT_SECRET = a strong random string
	•	SESSION_SECRET = same or another strong string
	•	ALLOWED_ORIGIN = https://flatmate-connect-mesudemirok.replit.app
	•	NODE_ENV = production
	•	Configure CORS to allow ALLOWED_ORIGIN, send credentials if using cookies.
	5.	Database URL must be a real Postgres URI (not the website URL):
	•	Use Publishing → “Production database connected → Manage → Copy connection string” and set DATABASE_URL to that full postgresql://… string.
	•	If needed, construct from existing PGHOST/PGPORT/PGDATABASE/PGUSER/PGPASSWORD as:
postgresql://PGUSER:PGPASSWORD@PGHOST:PGPORT/PGDATABASE?sslmode=require
	•	Make sure Drizzle/ORM reads from DATABASE_URL.
	6.	Frontend auth UI (Turkish stays):
	•	Keep “Üye Ol” and “Giriş Yap” pages/forms wired to the above endpoints.
	•	On successful login, show Çıkış Yap and allow access to /create-listing.
	•	If not logged in and user hits /create-listing, redirect to /auth/login?next=/create-listing.
	7.	Republish so prod picks up envs and changes.

Acceptance criteria (please verify before finishing):
	•	Visiting https://flatmate-connect-mesudemirok.replit.app/auth/register lets me create a user with email/password (no Replit popup).
	•	Giriş Yap logs in; header shows Çıkış Yap.
	•	/create-listing loads the form when logged in, and redirects to login when logged out.
	•	No CORS errors in console; no 401/403 when authenticated.
	•	All UI text remains Turkish (existing i18n intact).
