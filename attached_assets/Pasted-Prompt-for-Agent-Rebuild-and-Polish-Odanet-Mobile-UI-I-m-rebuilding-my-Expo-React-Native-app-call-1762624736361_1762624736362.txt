Prompt for Agent — Rebuild and Polish Odanet Mobile UI

I’m rebuilding my Expo React Native app called Odanet, a modern roommate and room rental platform (similar to SpareRoom or Flatmate).
The current app already connects to my backend and shows real listing data, but the UI is raw and unstyled.
I want you to redesign and structure the mobile UI professionally, keeping the data logic exactly as is.

Goals:

Create a new clean layout using React Native Paper, expo-router, and expo-linear-gradient.

Add a Bottom Tab Navigator with four tabs:

🏠 Home (listings feed)

💬 Messages (chat placeholder for now)

❤️ Favorites (saved listings placeholder)

👤 Profile (login/account info)

Implement a Header with the app title “Odanet” and use the brand colors:

Primary: #00A6A6

Accent: #F2F2F2

Text: #222222

Convert listing cards into modern components with:

rounded corners

shadow and elevation

bold title + price line

location row with icon

and listing image (use a placeholder if none exists)

Apply consistent spacing and SafeArea handling for all screens.

Keep all API calls, logic, and backend endpoints intact — only improve UI/UX.

Prepare the structure for future login integration with SecureStore and Google OAuth.

Tech details:

Expo SDK 51

React Native 0.74+

React Native Paper for UI

Expo Router for navigation

The existing API base URL is: https://www.odanet.com.tr/api

Output:

Update the project under odanet-mobile/app/

Create these files if missing:

app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx (bottom tab layout)

app/(tabs)/index.tsx (home)

app/(tabs)/messages.tsx

app/(tabs)/favorites.tsx

app/(tabs)/profile.tsx

components/ListingCard.tsx

Import icons from @expo/vector-icons

Ensure everything builds and runs on Android Expo Go with proper styling.

💡 After You Paste It:

Wait for Agent to complete setup and UI generation.

Run:

npm install react-native-paper @expo/vector-icons expo-linear-gradient
npm start


Test the app in Expo Go — you should now see a modern tabbed layout with proper design.
