🩺 REPLIT AGENT – FULL HEALTH & INTEGRITY CHECK PROMPT

Objective:
Run a full-stack health check and structural cleanup for my Odanet / FlatmateConnect web app hosted on Replit.
Diagnose all potential build, routing, dependency, and configuration issues.
Automatically repair safe-to-fix inconsistencies and produce a final report.

⸻

🧩 1️⃣ Scope of Inspection

Perform a complete analysis of these key folders and files (only these):

client/
server/
app/
routes/
drizzle/
migrations/
components/
constants/
hooks/
lib/
public/
vite.config.ts
drizzle.config.ts
app.config.ts
tailwind.config.ts
package.json
tsconfig.json

Do not touch or delete production data, .env values, or live database credentials.
Just read and verify their existence and correct linkage.

⸻

🔍 2️⃣ Codebase & Dependency Integrity
	•	Verify that all imports resolve successfully (no missing modules).
	•	Identify unused or broken imports across /client, /server, and /components.
	•	Detect deprecated or conflicting dependencies in package.json.
	•	Ensure all core packages are compatible with:

Node 20.x
npm 10+
Vite 5.x
React 19.x
Tailwind 3.x


	•	Flag outdated or insecure dependencies.
	•	Suggest dependency upgrades only when safe and compatible with Expo/Vite/Next builds.

⸻

🧱 3️⃣ Structural Validation
	•	Validate folder hierarchy:
	•	client → contains front-end entry points
	•	server → has proper route handlers under routes/
	•	drizzle → schema & migrations valid
	•	Detect redundant duplicate folders (e.g. scripts/, testApiConnection.ts outside intended structure).
	•	Flag large unused media in /assets or /public.

⸻

🔗 4️⃣ Routing & API Endpoint Verification
	•	Identify all /api/* routes from server/routes.ts and verify they:
	•	Return valid JSON or HTML
	•	Do not reference missing imports
	•	Use the correct environment variables (API base, DB URL, etc.)
	•	Test internal links between:
	•	/api/auth/*
	•	/api/listings/*
	•	/api/seekers/*
	•	/api/uploads/*
	•	Report any 404, CORS, or unhandled exception risks.

⸻

🧠 5️⃣ Build & Config Sanity Check
	•	Validate vite.config.ts for correct alias setup (@/* resolution).
	•	Ensure tailwind.config.ts references the right paths (e.g., ./app/**/*.{ts,tsx}).
	•	Confirm tsconfig.json paths align with imports.
	•	Detect and remove redundant build files or stale .d.ts declarations.
	•	Check package.json build scripts for missing commands or incorrect paths.

⸻

🌐 6️⃣ Link & Asset Health
	•	Scan all HTML and component files for:
	•	Broken image or script URLs
	•	Dead internal links
	•	Missing favicons or manifest references
	•	Validate canonical, meta, and SEO tags for www.odanet.com.tr.

⸻

🔐 7️⃣ Authentication & Security Basics
	•	Confirm that OAuth / Clerk / Google Login endpoints exist and respond (if active).
	•	Check HTTPS redirect handling.
	•	Ensure no plaintext secrets or tokens in source.
	•	Confirm cookie/session management is secure (SameSite, HttpOnly, Secure).

⸻

🧹 8️⃣ Safe Auto-Fix Actions
	•	Remove empty folders and leftover files (e.g. .old, .tmp, .log, .backup).
	•	Update outdated imports to the correct alias if vite.config.ts defines them.
	•	Normalize inconsistent TypeScript imports (e.g., .ts vs .tsx).
	•	Re-link static assets if missing.
	•	Ensure all export default statements match the file name and component type.

📊 9️⃣ Final Output Report

After completion, produce a single summarized report:

✅ Codebase Health: [Excellent / Good / Needs Attention]
✅ Build Scripts: [OK / Broken / Missing commands]
✅ Routing & API: [OK / Broken endpoints found]
✅ Dependencies: [Up to date / Needs minor updates]
✅ Security: [Secure / Risk found in X]
✅ Performance: [Optimized / Unused assets in public/]
✅ SEO & Links: [Valid / Broken links found: n]
✅ Cleanup: [Completed / Remaining manual review required]

📁 Files cleaned: 34
📦 Dependencies checked: 117
🧠 Issues auto-fixed: 12
⚠️ Issues requiring review: 2 (listed below)

Then provide a human-readable summary of the most critical issues and suggest next actions.

⸻

⚙️ 10️⃣ Final Verification Command (optional)

After fixes, execute and confirm:

npm install
npm run build
npm run dev

If build succeeds with no errors — mark project health as ✅ READY.

⸻

✅ Expected Result

“Full-stack audit completed.
Web app files preserved.
Mobile artifacts removed.
All configuration, dependencies, and routes validated.
Workspace optimized and healthy for deployment.”
