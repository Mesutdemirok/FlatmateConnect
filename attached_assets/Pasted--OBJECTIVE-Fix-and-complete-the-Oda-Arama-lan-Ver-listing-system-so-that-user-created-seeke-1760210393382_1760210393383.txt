🔹 OBJECTIVE

Fix and complete the “Oda Arama İlanı Ver” listing system so that user-created seeker listings:
	•	appear correctly in the user’s Profilim → İlanlarım section,
	•	display on the homepage under “Oda Arayanlar”,
	•	are editable by the user,
	•	and all pages are 100 % in Turkish, with no fake or English text remaining.

⸻

🔹 TASKS TO IMPLEMENT

1️⃣ Listing Visibility & Data Linking
	•	When a user submits the Oda Arama İlanı Ver form:
	•	Automatically create or update their seeker listing.
	•	Display it in two places:
	•	Profilim → İlanlarım tab.
	•	Homepage → “Oda Arayanlar” cards.
	•	Ensure each seeker listing is linked to that user’s account.
	•	If a user already has a seeker listing, submitting again should update it, not duplicate it.

⸻

2️⃣ Edit Listing Functionality
	•	Allow users to edit both “Oda İlanı” (room listing) and “Oda Arama İlanı” (seeker listing).
	•	Users can edit from:
	•	“Profilim → İlanlarım” tab, or
	•	the listing detail page (via an “İlanımı Düzenle” button).
	•	After editing, data must sync immediately on:
	•	Homepage listing cards,
	•	Profile listing view,
	•	Database backend.

⸻

3️⃣ Remove Fake / Irrelevant Data

From Profilim → Kişisel Bilgiler, remove these unnecessary elements:
	•	⭐ “4.8 rating”
	•	“12 reviews”
	•	“Member since 2025”

Show only real, relevant data:
	•	Ad
	•	Soyad
	•	E-posta
	•	Profil fotoğrafı

⸻

4️⃣ Full Turkish Localization (No English Anywhere)
	•	Translate all remaining English text into Turkish.
	•	Specific replacements:
	•	“Account Details” → “Hesap Bilgileri”
	•	“Verification Status” → “Doğrulama Durumu”
	•	“unverified” → “Doğrulanmadı”
	•	Check every component (Profile, Listing, Homepage, Header, Buttons, Forms, etc.) for leftover English text and translate to Turkish.
	•	No English phrases should remain across any UI element.

⸻

5️⃣ Homepage & Card Integration
	•	Make sure “Oda Arayanlar” cards display real seeker data from the database.
	•	Each card should show:
	•	Profil fotoğrafı (or default avatar)
	•	Ad Soyad (first name + initial)
	•	Yaş
	•	Cinsiyet
	•	Aylık bütçe (₺…/ay)
	•	Lokasyon
	•	Prevent placeholder or repeated data (no “İstanbul” clones or static examples).
	•	Cards link to the seeker’s detail or editable profile.

⸻

6️⃣ Fix Submission Flow
	•	Confirm that submitting Oda Arama İlanı Ver correctly saves all data and photo uploads.
	•	If validation errors like Expected string, received number occur:
	•	Adjust backend schema to accept both string and numeric input for rent/budget.
	•	Normalize these fields server-side before saving.
	•	Verify that uploaded photos save to /uploads, display in profile and card views.

⸻

7️⃣ Verification & Testing

After implementing everything:
	1.	Rebuild and start the project.
	2.	Create a new seeker listing with a profile photo.
	3.	Verify it appears:
	•	In Profilim → İlanlarım.
	•	On Homepage → Oda Arayanlar.
	4.	Edit the listing and confirm it updates everywhere instantly.
	5.	Check the profile and ensure all text is in Turkish.
	6.	Ensure there are no fake “rating/review/member since” elements.
	7.	Confirm homepage cards use the real database data.

⸻

✅ EXPECTED OUTCOME
	•	Users can submit, view, and edit both listing types (“Oda İlanı” & “Oda Arayan İlanı”).
	•	Data syncs seamlessly between form, profile, and homepage.
	•	All UI is fully Turkish and realistic.
	•	No dummy or English text remains.
	•	Project rebuilds and runs cleanly without validation or console errors.
