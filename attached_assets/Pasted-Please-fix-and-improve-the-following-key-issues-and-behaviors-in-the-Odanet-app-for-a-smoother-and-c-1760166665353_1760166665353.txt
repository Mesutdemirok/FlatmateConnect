Please fix and improve the following key issues and behaviors in the Odanet app for a smoother and consistent experience across all users (logged-in or guest).  

---

### 🔧 1. Listing Form Submission Issue
- When creating a new “İlan” (listing), the form doesn’t submit after all sections are filled.
✅ Fix:
- Identify the cause (frontend validation or backend POST issue).
- Ensure the “İlan Oluştur” button correctly triggers listing creation and sends form data (including images and metadata) to the backend.
- Confirm success redirects the user to the new listing’s details page with a success toast message.

---

### 🟣 2. Public Access to Room Seeker Cards
- Currently, “Oda Arayanlar” cards are visible only to logged-in users.
✅ Fix:
- Make all seeker cards (FeaturedRoomSeekers + Oda Arayanlar page) publicly visible.
- Ensure guest users can view these cards and click them without needing to log in.

---

### 🔗 3. Room Seeker Card Links (404 Fix)
- Clicking a seeker card leads to “404 Sayfa Bulunamadı”.
✅ Fix:
- Ensure each seeker card links correctly to its dynamic detail page (e.g., `/seekers/:id`).
- Restore or create the corresponding route and page to show full seeker profile details.

---

### 👤 4. Redirect After Login
✅ Update login flow:
- After successful login, redirect users automatically to their **Profile page** instead of the homepage.
- Show a short success toast like “Hoş geldiniz, [userName]!”

---

### 🏠 5. Consistent Homepage for All Users
✅ Fix:
- Make the homepage visually identical for logged-in and guest users.
- Ensure both can see the same hero section, listings, and room seekers.
- Adjust header buttons dynamically (e.g., “Üye Ol” → “Profil / Çıkış Yap” when logged in).

---

### 🧠 6. Optional Enhancements (recommended for better UX)
- Add loading states to “İlan Oluştur” and “Oda Arayanlar” sections for smoother feedback.
- Improve form validation messages (e.g., “Lütfen fiyat giriniz” instead of generic errors).
- Optimize card image display with fallback placeholders if no image uploaded.
- Improve mobile spacing between hero, listings, and seeker cards.

---

### 🧩 7. Post-Fix Verification
After applying the fixes:
✅ Test all main flows:
1. Submit a listing (İlan oluştur)
2. View seekers on homepage (logged out)
3. Click a seeker card (navigate to correct profile)
4. Login → automatically redirected to profile
5. Check homepage looks identical for both logged and guest users

Please implement all fixes above and perform a full functionality check to ensure everything works smoothly.  
Keep the current purple gradient aesthetic and existing UI design consistent.
