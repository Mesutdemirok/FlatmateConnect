Please implement the following UI and functional improvements based on the attached screenshots and descriptions:

1️⃣ **Header Buttons Visibility Fix**
- When logged in, the “Profil” and “Çıkış Yap” buttons blend into the header because of same background and text color.
- Fix this by changing button text color to a darker tone (e.g., text-indigo-700) and keeping the background white.
- Ensure both buttons are always clearly visible against the header gradient (desktop and mobile).

2️⃣ **Heart and Message Icons Styling**
- Replace both icons with thicker, more visible versions (filled or bold outline).
- Add a slightly darker background behind them (like `bg-white/10 hover:bg-white/20`) to improve contrast.
- Keep icons the same in desktop and mobile versions, consistent style and alignment.

3️⃣ **Remove "Apartman" Option**
- In the “Konut tipi nedir?” dropdown menu, remove only the “Apartman” option.
- Keep other options intact: “Rezidans”, “Daire”, “Müstakil Ev”, “Diğer”.

4️⃣ **Fiyata Faturalar Dahil mi? Logic**
- When the user selects “Evet”, do nothing extra.
- When the user selects “Hayır”, automatically show additional checkboxes or input fields below for:
  - Su
  - Elektrik
  - Telefon
  - Doğalgaz
  - İnternet
- These should appear dynamically and allow users to mark which bills are excluded or enter approximate amounts if needed.

5️⃣ **General Testing**
- After applying all fixes, test both logged-in and logged-out states.
- Confirm that:
  - “Profil” and “Çıkış Yap” buttons are always readable.
  - Icons appear correctly on both desktop and mobile.
  - “Apartman” option is removed.
  - “Fiyata Faturalar Dahil mi?” conditional fields work smoothly without breaking form submission.

✅ Please apply all changes cleanly and update both frontend and backend logic if necessary.
✅ Make sure everything is responsive, visually balanced, and consistent with Odanet’s purple/orange color theme.
✅ Rebuild and test on the live `.replit.app` environment before completion.
