Please rebuild the authentication page (currently /giris and /uye-ol) into a single unified, mobile-first responsive page.

🎯 Goal:
Combine both “Giriş Yap” (Login) and “Üye Ol” (Register) forms into one page with tab or toggle switching, while keeping all existing authentication and backend logic untouched.

🧩 Design & Functionality Requirements:

1. **Single Page Layout**
   - Merge both forms into one page (e.g., `/auth` or `/giris`).
   - At the top, add two tabs or toggle buttons:
     - “Giriş Yap”
     - “Üye Ol”
   - The active tab should be visually highlighted with the Odanet brand color (purple gradient currently used in the header).

2. **Form Behavior**
   - Only one form should be visible at a time.
   - Switching tabs should not reload the page — just toggle visibility (React state-based switch).
   - Keep all validation and API calls as they are.
   - Keep existing endpoints: `/api/auth/login` and `/api/auth/register`.

3. **Mobile-First Design**
   - Must look clean and readable on small screens (e.g., iPhone SE).
   - Use full width for form fields.
   - Buttons must have adequate padding and no overflow.
   - Avoid horizontal scrolling — content should fit within screen width.

4. **Social Login Section**
   - Add a divider with text “veya” (or).
   - Below it, add two placeholder buttons:
     - “Google ile giriş yap”
     - “Facebook ile giriş yap”
   - Use brand-appropriate colors:
     - Google → white background, gray border
     - Facebook → blue background (#1877F2), white text
   - These buttons are temporary (no functional logic).

5. **Styling**
   - Use the same typography, button, and input styles already defined in the app (Tailwind + shadcn/ui).
   - Ensure color palette matches Odanet’s current purple theme.
   - Background should remain light (like the current login page).
   - Keep rounded form container with shadow and consistent spacing.

6. **Performance**
   - Optimize for mobile rendering.
   - No heavy animations or external dependencies.
   - Maintain accessibility (labels, focus states, tab navigation).

7. **Backend & Logic**
   - Do not change any backend routes or authentication logic.
   - Do not touch session or JWT configuration.
   - Only modify frontend components and routing.

🎨 Inspiration:
Think Airbnb or Roomster mobile login — single unified interface where users can toggle between login/register quickly.

✅ Deliverable:
A fully functional, mobile-optimized `/auth` (or `/giris`) page that allows toggling between “Giriş Yap” and “Üye Ol” in one screen, with social login placeholders at the bottom, using existing codebase and styling system.
