Fix all backend and frontend issues preventing full functionality on https://www.odanet.com.tr.

1️⃣ SEEKER PROFILE CREATION
• The POST request to /api/seekers returns error: "column 'is_smoker' of relation 'seeker_profiles' does not exist".
→ Add the missing columns `is_smoker VARCHAR(10)` and `has_pets VARCHAR(10)` to the seeker_profiles table in Neon Postgres.
→ Update schema definitions (Drizzle schema, Zod schema, and any ORM mapping) so that the backend can correctly insert and read these fields.
→ Verify that when users submit the seeker profile form, their data is saved successfully in the database and returned in GET /api/seekers.

2️⃣ HOMEPAGE LISTINGS
• Currently the homepage only shows “Room Listings” and not “Room Seeker” cards.
→ Fetch both room listings and seeker listings from the database.
→ Display seeker cards alongside room cards in the home page search view.
→ Ensure both types have proper filtering (e.g., “Oda Ara” and “Oda Arkadaşı Ara”) and correct image handling.

3️⃣ USER DASHBOARD (Profilim → İlanlarım)
• When a user has created both a room listing and a room seeker listing, only room listings appear.
→ Make sure the user profile page (/profil) lists both:
   - Oda İlanlarım (room listings)
   - Oda Arama İlanlarım (seeker listings)
→ Fetch them from the correct tables, show status (active, pending, etc.), and allow edit/delete for each.

4️⃣ MESSAGING (Sunucu hatası)
• Sending a message fails with "Sunucu hatası, lütfen daha sonra tekrar deneyiniz".
→ Fix the backend message API (check /api/messages or socket events).
→ Verify that:
   - WebSocket or fetch connection works correctly in production,
   - CORS and SameSite cookie policies are configured properly for the domain .odanet.com.tr,
   - Message creation, retrieval, and notification flow are functional.

5️⃣ FINAL TESTS
→ Test full flow in production:
   - Register or login (both email/password and Google OAuth),
   - Create both room and seeker listings,
   - View them on homepage and profile page,
   - Send and receive messages without errors.
→ Clean up console logs and ensure all API routes return proper JSON (no 404s).

Goal: Make the entire Odanet platform production-ready with all core features (login, listings, seeker profiles, messages) working flawlessly on https://www.odanet.com.tr.
