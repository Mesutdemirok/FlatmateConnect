⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE:
The new forms (Oda İlanı Ver and Kullanıcı Profili) still cannot be submitted successfully.  
I have tested both forms manually, and the submission fails with this error:

❌ [plugin:runtime-error-plugin] 400:  
"Expected string, received number"  
Fields affected: rentAmount, budgetMonthly (and possibly others).

Please fix this issue completely and test both forms end-to-end before deployment.

### 🔧 1️⃣ Fix the Submission Type Error
- Diagnose and fix the backend schema or validation issue.
- The current backend expects `rentAmount` and `budgetMonthly` as **string**, but the frontend sends **number**.
✅ Fix options (choose one consistent approach):
  - Either update backend schema (Zod / Drizzle / Prisma) to accept numbers,  
  **OR**
  - Convert numeric values to strings in frontend before submission.
- Ensure the form successfully posts to `/api/listings` and `/api/seekers` without throwing a 400 error.

---

### 🧪 2️⃣ Test the Entire Flow Thoroughly
Perform full QA testing on both forms:

**Oda İlanı Formu**
- Fill out all fields, upload photos, and click “İlan Oluştur”.
- Confirm success toast “İlan başarıyla oluşturuldu.” appears.
- Confirm listing is created in database and visible on homepage.
- Confirm redirect to listing detail page (`/oda-ilani/:id`).

**Kullanıcı Profili Formu**
- Fill out all fields, including numeric “bütçe”.
- Submit and confirm success toast “Profil başarıyla oluşturuldu.”
- Check that user data is correctly stored and visible on `/profil`.

✅ Make sure no validation errors appear in the console.
✅ Verify all required fields are saved with correct types (numbers, strings, booleans).
✅ Confirm the API returns 200 OK on success.

### 🧩 3️⃣ Verify Full Integration
After fixing and testing:
- Confirm new listing and seeker data both appear on the homepage and “Oda Arayanlar” section.
- Confirm images upload properly and display correctly.
- Ensure both forms are mobile responsive and usable.

---

### 🚀 4️⃣ Final Step
Once both forms are fully working:
- Rebuild (`npm run build`)
- Restart the server
- Deploy automatically to `.replit.app`
- Verify submission flow in live production build.

⚠️ Reminder:
This issue must be resolved fully — the “İlan Oluştur” and “Profil Oluştur” forms must be **tested and functional** before marking this task complete.
