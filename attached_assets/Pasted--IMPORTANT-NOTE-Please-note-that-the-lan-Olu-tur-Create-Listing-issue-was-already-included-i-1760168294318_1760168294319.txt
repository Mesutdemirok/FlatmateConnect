⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE:
Please note that the “İlan Oluştur” (Create Listing) issue was already included in a previous workflow and charged, but it was never fixed.  
Kindly complete this fix properly now and consider it as part of the previous task, without any additional charge.

---

Now, please carefully fix and enhance the Odanet app with the following updates.  
After completing all fixes, rebuild and redeploy automatically to production.

---

### 🔧 1. Listing Form — “İlan Oluştur” Button Not Working
- The listing creation form accepts uploaded images but doesn’t submit when “İlan Oluştur” is clicked.
✅ Fix:
- Diagnose and fix the root cause (frontend handler, API route, or form validation issue).
- Ensure all fields (title, description, price, location, uploaded photos, etc.) are properly sent to `/api/listings`.
- After success:
  - Show toast: “İlan başarıyla oluşturuldu.”
  - Redirect user to the new listing’s detail page.
- On error: show “Bir hata oluştu, lütfen tekrar deneyin.”

---

### 🟣 2. Room Seeker Cards (Oda Arayanlar)
✅ Fix:
- Allow everyone (including guests) to see all seeker cards on the homepage and “Oda Arayanlar” page.
- Fix the broken links (currently go to 404).
- Restore or create the dynamic route for each seeker’s detail page → `/oda-arayanlar/:id`.
- Display seeker info, age, gender, budget, description, and location clearly.

---

### 👤 3. Redirect After Login
✅ Improve flow:
- After a successful login, redirect users directly to their **profile** page (`/profil`).
- Show toast: “Hoş geldiniz, [userName]!”
- Keep existing JWT authentication intact.

---

### 🏠 4. Consistent Homepage (for All Users)
✅ Fix:
- Make the homepage identical for both guest and logged-in users.
- Both should see:
  - Hero section
  - Featured Listings
  - Featured Room Seekers
  - Footer
- Only header buttons change dynamically (Üye Ol → Profil / Çıkış Yap).

---

### 🌍 5. Change All URL Paths to Turkish
✅ Convert all current and new page URLs from English to Turkish equivalents.
Example changes:
- `/login` → `/giris`
- `/register` → `/uye-ol`
- `/listings` → `/oda-ilanlari`
- `/listing/:id` → `/oda-ilani/:id`
- `/seekers` → `/oda-arayanlar`
- `/seeker/:id` → `/oda-arayan/:id`
- `/profile` → `/profil`
- `/create-listing` → `/ilan-olustur`
- `/how-it-works` → `/nasil-calisir`
Ensure internal navigation, links, and redirects all work properly after renaming.

---

### ✨ 6. UX/UI Enhancements
- Add loading animation during listing submission.
- Add required field validation (title, price, location).
- Improve error messages (e.g., “Lütfen fiyat giriniz.”)
- Ensure consistent purple gradient background and mobile responsiveness.

---

### ✅ 7. Verification Checklist
After applying all fixes:
1. “İlan Oluştur” creates listing successfully and redirects correctly.
2. Guests can view seeker cards and open their detail pages.
3. No 404 errors on seeker pages.
4. Logged-in users redirect to `/profil` after login.
5. Homepage consistent for all users.
6. All URLs now use Turkish names and work correctly.
7. Site styling and gradients remain unchanged.

---

### 🚀 8. Deployment
- Run `npm run build` and restart server.
- Redeploy automatically to the `.replit.app` production URL.
- Test all functionality after deployment.

⚠️ Reminder: Please treat this as continuation of the previously billed fix for the listing form issue.
