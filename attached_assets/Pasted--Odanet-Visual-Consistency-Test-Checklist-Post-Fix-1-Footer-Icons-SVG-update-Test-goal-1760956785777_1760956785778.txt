✅ Odanet Visual Consistency Test Checklist (Post-Fix)

🔹 1️⃣ Footer Icons (SVG update)

Test goal: confirm new icons (Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, Pinterest, YouTube) render cleanly.

Steps:
	•	Open your website → scroll to footer.
	•	Hover over each icon:
	•	The orange background should glow slightly and scale up (hover:scale-105).
	•	The icon itself should stay white, not gray or black.
	•	The circle should show a faint white ring glow.
	•	Click each icon:
	•	Should open the correct social page in a new tab.
	•	Check URLs are correct:

instagram.com/odanet.com.tr
facebook.com/odanet.com.tr
tiktok.com/@odanet.com.tr
pinterest.com/odanet_/
youtube.com/@odanet_com_tr



🟢 If any icon doesn’t appear:
→ Verify the file path under /public/icons/ matches exactly (e.g., facebook.svg, not .jpeg).
→ If dark, open the file and replace any fill="#000" with fill="currentColor".

⸻

🔹 2️⃣ Room & Seeker Cards Height (Desktop)

Test goal: ensure cards align cleanly on desktop grid.

Steps:
	•	Resize browser to ≥1024px width (desktop).
	•	Observe the card grid (both Oda İlanları and Oda Arayanlar pages).
	•	Each card:
	•	Same height (top and bottom edges aligned).
	•	Images cropped evenly (no stretched faces or gray gaps).
	•	Buttons and text inside cards aligned consistently.

🟢 Expected visual cue: each row of cards forms a clean horizontal line — no “bumpy” layout.

⸻

🔹 3️⃣ Mobile Responsiveness (No Regression)

Test goal: confirm agent fix didn’t affect mobile behavior.

Steps:
	•	Open your website on Safari mobile or Chrome mobile simulator.
	•	Cards should shrink naturally (no cutoff).
	•	Image proportions preserved (object-cover).
	•	Footer icons centered and not stacked oddly.

🟢 Expected result: layout remains identical to your previous mobile look.

⸻

🔹 4️⃣ Hover / Focus Behavior

Test goal: confirm transitions look professional and not jittery.

Steps:
	•	Hover over any card → should show subtle lift (shadow-lg or translate).
	•	Hover over any footer icon → slight orange glow and scale.
	•	Click tab key through icons → visible focus outline (accessibility test).

🟢 Expected: consistent hover response across all interactive elements.

⸻

🔹 5️⃣ Cross-Browser Check

Test goal: confirm Safari and Chrome render gradients and shadows identically.

Steps:
	•	Open both browsers side-by-side.
	•	Compare:
	•	Footer background gradient (from-indigo-700 → to-fuchsia-700) should match tone and brightness.
	•	Orange hover glow should appear equally strong.
	•	Texts remain crisp, no blurry scaling.

🟢 Optional: use Chrome DevTools → “Rendering → Emulate Vision Deficiencies” to confirm contrast passes accessibility (minimum AA level).

⸻

🎯 Final Verification

Once these checks pass, your frontend is visually production-ready:
	•	Consistent card grid height
	•	Unified image proportions
	•	Correct SVG rendering
	•	Polished footer visual hierarchy
