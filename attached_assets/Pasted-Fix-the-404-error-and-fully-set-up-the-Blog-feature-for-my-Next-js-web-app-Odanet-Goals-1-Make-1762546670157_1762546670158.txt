Fix the 404 error and fully set up the Blog feature for my Next.js web app (Odanet).

Goals:
1. Make the /blog route work correctly and display the blog list.
2. Add dynamic routes for each blog post (e.g., /blog/oda-kiralamada-guvenlik).
3. Create a consistent layout with title, description, date, and SEO tags.
4. Style the blog list and post pages with Tailwind (clean, card-like, responsive).
5. Add sample posts and make it easy for me to add more later.
6. Ensure metadata is set up for each post (title, description, date, slug).
7. Add automatic canonical links and open graph tags (og:title, og:description).
8. Fix folder structure if needed — move blog under src/pages/blog (not client/src/).
9. Add a not-found fallback for missing blog posts.
10. Connect the blog page to the main site navigation (“Blog” link in header/footer).

Technical Details:
- Stack: Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- Current file structure: src/pages/index.tsx, src/pages/blog/index.tsx exists
- The /blog route returns “404 Sayfa Bulunamadı” right now
- Replit environment with Vite/Next hybrid build

Tasks:
1. Detect and fix the routing issue so /blog works.
2. Create /src/pages/blog/[slug].tsx for dynamic post details.
3. Add SEO-friendly metadata (title, description, date).
4. Update index.tsx (homepage) to include a “Blog” button linking to /blog.
5. Add responsive grid design for blog cards with hover effects.
6. Add markdown support using next-mdx or react-markdown for rich post content.
7. Add 3 sample blog posts with Turkish titles:
   - “Türkiye’de Oda Kiralamada Güvenlik Rehberi”
   - “Ev Arkadaşıyla Yaşamda Dikkat Edilmesi Gerekenler”
   - “Oda İlanı Yayınlarken Dolandırıcılıktan Korunma İpuçları”
8. Each post should have title, date, and meta description.
9. Verify navigation works between list and post pages.
10. Deploy and confirm that /blog and /blog/[slug] pages are live.

After completion:
✅ /blog → Blog list
✅ /blog/oda-kiralamada-guvenlik → Blog detail page
✅ All pages styled and SEO meta added
✅ No 404 errors

Finally, provide a summary of what was created (files + routes) and confirm that navigation and SEO metadata are working.
