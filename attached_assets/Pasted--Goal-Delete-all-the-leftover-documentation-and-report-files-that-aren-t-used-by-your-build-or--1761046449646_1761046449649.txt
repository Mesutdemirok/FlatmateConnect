🎯 Goal

Delete all the leftover documentation and report files that aren’t used by your build or app logic — the ones like:

CDN_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md
CDN_VERIFICATION_REPORT.md
DEPLOYMENT_FIX_SUMMARY.md
HEALTH_CHECK_REPORT.md
IMAGES_FIXED_SUMMARY.md
PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_FINAL.md
PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md
PRODUCTION_SYNC_GUIDE.md
URGENT_SSL_FIX.md
VISUAL_CONSISTENCY_VERIFICATION.md

These are just logs or temporary reports from Replit’s AI agent.
They don’t affect SEO, frontend, backend, or deployment.

✅ What to tell the agent

You can copy & paste this prompt directly into the Replit agent chat:

🧠 Prompt to Replit Agent:

Task:
Clean up and reorganize the project structure.

1. Delete all unnecessary markdown files in the project root (like reports, guides, and summaries).
Remove every file that ends with .md except README.md if it exists.

2. Keep only:
	•	client/ (frontend)
	•	server/ (backend)
	•	shared/
	•	scripts/
	•	uploads/
	•	configuration files (vite.config.ts, tailwind.config.ts, tsconfig.json, replit.md, .gitignore, etc.)

3. After cleanup:
	•	Ensure folder hierarchy stays correct.
	•	Do not touch anything under client/src or server/.
	•	Confirm the cleanup in a summary report after deletion.

⸻

Once you run that, the agent will clean everything and confirm.
That step will remove all unnecessary documentation clutter.

🚀 PHASE 2 — Fix SEO Slug Logic (for better results)

After cleanup, we’ll finalize the slug SEO system:

🔧 Tasks we’ll apply:
	1.	Backend:
	•	Add slug creation (using slugify + shortid)
	•	Add /api/listings/slug/:slug endpoint
	•	Add redirect for old /api/listings/:id routes
	2.	Frontend:
	•	Confirm FeaturedListings.tsx uses listing.slug
	•	Create client/src/pages/oda-ilani/[slug].tsx
(so it dynamically loads listings by slug)
	•	Add SEO <Helmet> tags per page
	3.	Verification:
	•	Test new URLs in browser (example: /oda-ilani/nisantasi-merkezde-ferah-daıre-istanbul-abc123)
	•	Re-run sitemap generator so these new URLs appear.
