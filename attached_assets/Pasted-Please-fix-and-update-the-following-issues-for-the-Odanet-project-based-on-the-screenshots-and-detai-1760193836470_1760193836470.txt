Please fix and update the following issues for the Odanet project based on the screenshots and details:

1️⃣ **Listing Detail Page – Data Binding Fix**
- The information from the listing form (address, rent, property type, room details, etc.) is not showing correctly on the Listing Detail page.
- Make sure all listing data fields from the form are properly displayed on the detail page.
- Example: address, title, rent amount, included/excluded bills, property type, furniture status, internet availability, and roommate preferences.
- Confirm data is pulled from the database dynamically and matches what was submitted via the form.

2️⃣ **Pricing Format**
- The pricing currently shows as “₺18.000,00/hafta”.
- Change it to **monthly format** instead → “₺18.000/ay”.
- Ensure this change applies across the site (both in detail pages and listing cards).

3️⃣ **Owner Section (“Mülk Sahibi”) Cleanup**
- Remove the rating text and star symbol (“4.8 puan • değerlendirme”).
- Keep only:  
  - Owner name (e.g., “Mahmut Tuncer”)  
  - “Mülk Sahibi” label  
  - Verified badge if available.

4️⃣ **Homepage Listing Cards**
- Current cards show repetitive “İstanbul, Konforlu, merkezi konumda...” texts.
- Replace with dynamic listing data from database — use real title and short description from each listing form.
- Add the listing title on top of each card (e.g., “Maltepe Ritim İstanbul’da Metroya Yakın Eşyalı Oda”).
- Ensure cards show correct rent (₺x.xxx/ay) and district/location underneath.

5️⃣ **Homepage Section Titles**
- Add a section title above the listing cards:  
  **“Güncel İlanlar”**
- Remove the redundant text under “Oda Arayanlar”.
  - Delete: “Evinize uygun ev arkadaşı bulun.”
  - Keep only the section title “Oda Arayanlar”.

6️⃣ **General Design & Consistency**
- Ensure spacing and alignment between cards are balanced.
- Make titles bold, readable, and uniform with other headings.
- Check responsiveness — confirm the layout works cleanly on mobile.

7️⃣ **Testing**
- Verify that new listings submitted from the form now appear correctly on:
  - Homepage listing cards.
  - Listing detail page.
- Confirm all form data saves correctly and maps to the right display fields.
- Ensure that there are no broken bindings or missing fields.

✅ After completing all fixes:
- Rebuild and test the full flow:
  - Create a new test listing.
  - Confirm it appears on homepage and opens with full correct details.
  - Check price shows monthly.
- Ensure everything matches the Odanet color and design theme.
