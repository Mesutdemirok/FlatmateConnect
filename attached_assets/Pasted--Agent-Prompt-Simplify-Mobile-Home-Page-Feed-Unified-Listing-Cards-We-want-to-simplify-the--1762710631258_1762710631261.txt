🧠 Agent Prompt — Simplify Mobile Home Page Feed (Unified Listing Cards)

We want to simplify the Odanet mobile app home screen to work exactly like the website homepage.
Currently, the mobile home (/app/(tabs)/index.tsx) shows separate sections:
	•	🏡 “Oda İlanları” (room listings)
	•	👥 “Oda Arkadaşı Arayanlar” (room seekers)
	•	🔍 Search bar at the top

We want to merge and simplify everything into a single unified feed.

✅ Here’s exactly what to do:
	1.	Delete / disable:
	•	The “Oda İlanları” section
	•	The “Oda Arkadaşı Arayanlar” section
	•	The search box component
	2.	Create one combined feed, showing all listings and seekers together in a single vertical scroll (like the website homepage).
	3.	Each card should:
	•	Use the same design as our existing ListingCard and SeekerCard
	•	Automatically detect the type (type: "listing" or "seeker")
	•	Display a small label (e.g. “Oda İlanı” or “Oda Arkadaşı Arıyor”) inside the card for clarity
	4.	Fetch both datasets from their APIs:

const [listings, seekers] = await Promise.all([
  fetch(`${base}/listings`).then(r => r.json()),
  fetch(`${base}/users/seekers`).then(r => r.json()),
]);

Then merge them into one array sorted by createdAt descending.
Example:

const combinedFeed = [...listings, ...seekers].sort(
  (a, b) => new Date(b.createdAt) - new Date(a.createdAt)
);


	5.	Display combinedFeed in one unified <ScrollView> or <FlatList>, mapping through each item:

{combinedFeed.map((item) =>
  item.type === "listing"
    ? <ListingCard key={item.id} listing={item} />
    : <SeekerCard key={item.id} seeker={item} />
)}


	6.	Result:
	•	One clean continuous feed
	•	No toggles, no search bar
	•	The homepage feels like the website: all listings + seekers mixed chronologically
	7.	Test that both data sources load correctly and display on Expo (verify with console logs).

💡 Goal summary:

Make the Odanet mobile homepage mirror the website experience: one unified feed containing both room listings and seekers together — no separate sections, no search, just a modern continuous list.
