### 🔹 Objective:
Unify the “Oda Arama İlanı Ver” (room seeker listing) and “Tercihlerim” (preferences) forms into a single, consistent and working system with photo upload and full homepage integration.

---

### 🔹 Tasks to Implement:

1️⃣ **Unified Data Model**
- Merge `SeekerProfile` and `Preferences` into a single combined data model (e.g. `SeekerProfileExtended`).
- Include these fields:
  - Ad Soyad
  - Yaş
  - Cinsiyet
  - Durum (Öğrenci / Çalışan)
  - Aylık kira bütçesi
  - Lokasyon
  - Kendini tanıtma açıklaması
  - Profil fotoğrafı
  - Sigara tercihi
  - Evcil hayvan tercihi
  - Temizlik seviyesi
  - Sosyallik seviyesi
  - Çalışma saatleri
  - Cinsiyet tercihi
  - Yaş aralığı (min-max)
- Use one unified table and automatically connect updates between profile and listing.

---

2️⃣ **Photo Upload Functionality**
- Fix the photo upload system end-to-end:
  - Allow users to upload JPG, PNG, or WebP (max 5MB).
  - Store the image in the `/uploads` folder (or configured storage).
  - Save its URL in the seeker profile record.
  - Show uploaded photo:
    - In the user’s profile
    - On the homepage under “Oda Arayanlar” cards
  - If no image exists, show a default placeholder avatar.
- Test upload workflow completely (select → save → visible on homepage card).

---

3️⃣ **Profile & Listing Sync**
- When a user updates their profile or unified form:
  - Sync all changes automatically with the public “Oda Arayanlar” listing.
  - Ensure one data source only (no duplicate records).
  - Updating from the profile page should instantly update homepage cards too.

---

4️⃣ **Unified Form UI & Flow**
- Keep both top menu options:
  - “Oda İlanı Ver”
  - “Oda Arama İlanı Ver”
- When user clicks “Oda Arama İlanı Ver”:
  - Redirect to the new unified form.
  - After completion, show a confirmation message and automatically create/update their public card.
- In profile page (“Profilim”), under “Hızlı İşlemler”:
  - “Oda İlanı Ver” → room listing form
  - “Oda Arama İlanı Ver” → unified seeker form (connected to preferences)

---

5️⃣ **Homepage Integration**
- Ensure the unified seeker profiles appear under “Oda Arayanlar”.
- Cards should display:
  - Photo (if available)
  - Ad Soyad (first name + initial)
  - Yaş
  - Cinsiyet
  - Bütçe (₺…/ay)
  - Lokasyon
  - Temizlik / Sigara / Cinsiyet tercihi (if filled)
- Make sure the data in cards comes directly from the unified model.

---

6️⃣ **Fix Known Bugs**
- Fix the previous validation errors:
  > “Expected string, received number” for `budgetMonthly` and `rentAmount`.
  → Adjust backend validation to accept both strings and numbers.
- Ensure all string-number mismatches are corrected.
- Fix photo upload not submitting properly.

---

7️⃣ **Localization**
- Convert all URLs and slugs in the app to Turkish (e.g. `/giris`, `/uye-ol`, `/oda-ilani-ver`, `/oda-arama-ilani-ver`, `/profil`, `/ilan/:id`).
- Update any English routes to their Turkish equivalents.

---

8️⃣ **Testing & Verification**
- Create and submit a new seeker profile.
- Upload a photo and verify it appears in:
  - Profile page
  - Oda Arayanlar homepage card
- Edit info (e.g., yaş, bütçe) from profile and check that homepage card updates automatically.
- Rebuild project, verify no runtime or console errors.

---

✅ **Expected Outcome:**
- A single unified and synced system for “Oda Arama İlanı”.
- Working photo upload and card display.
- Real-time synchronization between profile, preferences, and homepage.
- All Turkish routes working.
- No backend validation or type errors.

Rebuild after changes and show confirmation that the unified form, photo upload, and homepage card are functioning as expected.
